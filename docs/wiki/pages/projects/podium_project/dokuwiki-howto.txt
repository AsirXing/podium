====== DokuWiki HowTo ======

The DokuWiki instance in the Podium Collaboration Workspace is serving as a shared Knowledge Base for your project. We expect the project to be backed by a Git repository. To ensure consistency between your project Git repo, we initialize the DokuWiki from such repository.

===== Basic Setup =====

You give the URL of your Git repo as parameter to the OpenShift deployment template. If you leave this parameter empty, the default content from the Podium project ist loaded from https://github.com/sa-mw-dach/podium.git

The integration with DokuWiki requires your Git repo to provide a certain directory structure. We expect the Wiki content to be provided as shown in the following listing:

  docs/
       wiki/
            media/
                  wiki/
            pages/
                  wiki/start.txt


As you may expect, images and alike are stored in the media section, text files belong to pages. The root document for your wiki is the ''start.txt'' file which has to be provided exactly as shown in the ''pages/wiki'' folder.

Once you have this directory structure in place, you can simply provide the OpenShift Operator or the install template with the URL for your repo and you will instantly find the content of your provided ''pages/wiki'' in the Podium Knowledge Base.

With this basic setup, the content synchronization is a one time, one way replication.

===== Manual Content Push =====

In the default setup, every user of the Podium DokuWiki is allowed to edit and create documents in the Knowledge Base.

In order to push such changed or newly created documents back into your Git repository, you can ''rsh'' into the DokuWiki Pod running in OpenShift and perform the commit and push manually.

After pushing the new content into the Git repository, the content will be present even if you have to reinstall your Podium Collaboratin Workspace in another OpenShift Cluster.

===== Manual Content Pull =====

You must be aware that there is no synchronization from your Git repo to the DokuWiki after the initialization. If you have updates and changes in your repo that you want to make available in the Knowledge Base of your running Podium, you may log into the DokuWiki container like shown above and perform a ''git pull'' manually.

===== Re-Initialization =====

The DokuWiki makes use of a Persistent Volume in OpenShift to protect its content even in the case the DokuWiki container needs to be restarted.

In order to re-initialize the content from your Git repo, you again need to log into the running DokuWiki container like shown above and delete the content of the ''data/gitrepo'' directory. In particular, the file ''data/gitrepo/.git/config'' needs to be removed. As long as this config file is present, the content of your Git repo will not be cloned into the DokuWiki container.
